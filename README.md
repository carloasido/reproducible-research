# Coursera Reproducible Research

This repository contains exploratory analysis of severe weather phenomena in the United States as collected by the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The structure of the analysis is curated to follow the ideas of reproducible research. The goal is to create an analysis that can easily be reproduced so that [others can verify the findings and build upon them](https://www.coursera.org/learn/reproducible-research).

A more polished report can be found at https://rpubs.com/jasido/706549. Otherwise, `storm_data_analysis.md` contains the same analysis albeit not as neatly-formatted.
